Virtual File Systems
=====================

A Virtual File System (acronym VFS) is in theory a concept for
handling the loading of files from your Physical Drive/Disk
into the virtual space (RAM), a file in memory has
a location called the virtual path.

The files can contain other files inside them and the
VFS knows how to point to them, normally the files
and the files inside can also be compressed/encrypted
for saving space on disk, secure them, etc...
